## Useful commands

Open the Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux) and type in one of the following commands:

Command | Description
--- | ---
```Maya: Send Python Code to Maya``` | Send Python code from current editor in Maya.
```Maya: Send MEL Code to Maya``` | Send MEL code from current editor in Maya.

You can also select a block of code in the editor 
and ```Right-click -> Send Code to Maya```, this is based on the current working language (Mel or Python).


## Opening the correct ports for Send to Maya Commands.

To open the correct ports in maya, you can use the following code.

`Note: If your using a extension version higher than 0.9, then MEL and Python code use the same port in maya.`

In the Maya script editor MEL Tab.
```
commandPort -name "localhost:7001" -sourceType "mel" -echoOutput;
```
